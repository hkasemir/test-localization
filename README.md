# Test Localization

The purpose of this app is to try out different localization libraries to get a feel for the features and strategies
of several popular methods.


Each library will live in its own branch, at the moment, branches are planned for the following libraries:
- [fluent-react](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent.js/tree/master/fluent-react)
- [react-intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl)
- [react-i18next](https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next)


## to run locally

nvm use // node v8.9.1

```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
